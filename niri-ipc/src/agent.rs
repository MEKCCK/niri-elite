//! Types for driving the agent seat.
//!
//! The agent seat is a second `wl_seat` that niri creates on demand for automation. It has its
//! own pointer, keyboard focus and clipboard, so a program can click and type into a window while
//! the user keeps working on another one.
//!
//! Every action targets a window by id. Points are in logical pixels relative to the top-left
//! corner of the window geometry (the same corner that [`AgentCapture`] reports its origin
//! against), so they don't depend on where the window currently is on screen, or whether it's
//! visible at all.
